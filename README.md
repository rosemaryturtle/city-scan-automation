# README

This project collects and processes spatial data, and uses them to generate maps and charts to be used in local preparedness plans.

## To setup

First, clone this repository:

```
git clone --filter=tree:0 https://github.com/worldbank/crp-lgcrrp.git
```

Flood data is proprietary and therefore cannot be directly accessed by this public repository. To include flooding, please request flood data from rsu@worldbank.org. Once received, you will then place it in `mnt/source-data/` so that the resulting file path is `mnt/source-data/fathom/`.

## To run

This project has two phases: data collection & processing, and data visualization. The first phase is conducted by `01-main.py`, while `02-main.R` handles the second.

For data collection, you will need to
1. ensure city AOI (area of interest) is located in `mnt/01-user-input/AOI/`;
2. edit `mnt/01-user-input/city_inputs.yml` to name city and path to AOI;
3. edit `mnt/01-user-input/menu.yml` to only include the desired layers; and
4. run `01-main.py` with the command `python 01-main.py`

Once `01-main.py` has finished running, simply run `Rscript 02-main.R`

This process will result in a city-specific directory with spatial data files, maps, and charts.

```
- mnt/
	- city-directories/
		- <city name>/
			- 01-user-input/
			- 02-process-output/ (All of the intermediary files, mainly GeoTIFFs)
			- 03-render-output/
				- maps/
				- charts/
```

## Possible maps
