mnt/yyyy-mm-country-city

# Use this file to set the path to the city directory, relative to frontend/.
# The city directory will be created by the data processing step, and will have
# sub-folders called 01-user-inputs and 02-process-outputs. This directory is
# also where the visualizations will be saved.

# IMPORTANT
# The directory path must be relative to frontend/.
# The directory path must be on this file's first line.

# I suggest creating a mnt/ folder in backend/, where you would create the city
# directory, and then creating a soft link to it within frontend/. On a unix,
# this would be done with `ln -s backend/mnt frontend/mnt`, from the top level
# of the repo.
