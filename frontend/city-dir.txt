# Use this file to set the path to the city directory. The city directory will 
# be created by the data processing step, and will have sub-folders called
# 01-user-inputs and 02-process-outputs. This directory is also where the
# visualizations will be saved.

# This file may be hidden from git by using
#   git update-index --skip-worktree frontend/city-dir.txt
# to unhide, use
#   git update-index --no-skip-worktree frontend/city-dir.txt

# IMPORTANT
# The directory path must be on this file's first line.
