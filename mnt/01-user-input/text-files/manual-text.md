Goris is a town in the southern province of Syunik, Armenia. It is situated 240 km southeast of the capital, Yerevan, and 67 km from the provincial center, Kapan. Its origins trace back to the Stone Age, rendering it a significant historical and cultural site in Armenia. 

Goris’s economy is predominantly rooted in light industry, and the town hosts numerous food-processing plants. Notable industrial sectors include electric energy, food, textile and sewing, aluminum and metal-plastic products, woodworking and stone processing, and electronics. Its strategic position within Armenia’s road network, combined with its cultural and historical heritage, has contributed to its popularity as a tourist destination. Goris is positioned at the crossroads of international transit routes, with the potential to become a transit zone between Armenia and Iran, contributing to the formation of the Great Silk Road touristic route.

The city’s geography is characterized by its location in a mountainous region, presenting both opportunities and challenges for its economic development. Despite the economic hurdles confronting Armenia, there is a renewed emphasis on cultivating tech clusters in cities like Goris, indicating a growing inclination towards information technology as a crucial component of the city’s local economic development strategy. In addition, the high level of urbanization in the region has led to a focus on smart and sustainable urban development.

#### Land Administration

The Land Code of the Republic of Armenia serves as the fundamental framework for the country’s land administration system, encompassing a wide range of legal provisions related to land activities. In recent years, the Armenian government has established an effective and efficient land administration system, centralizing the registration of all types of real estate, including land, within a cadastre. The State Committee of Real Estate Cadastre (SCREC) plays a pivotal role in Armenia’s land administration system, being responsible for formulating land policies, managing land resources, promoting effective land utilization practices, and regulating land-related matters. Furthermore, the committee collaborates closely with local authorities to provide guidance on land use planning, zoning regulations, and the preparation of documents concerning changes in land use or designation. While the Ministry of Urban Development is primarily responsible for the development and implementation of housing policy in Armenia, certain aspects of program implementation are delegated to sub-national governments including marzes (regions) and local communities (municipalities). 

#### Energy

Armenia heavily depends on imported natural gas and oil to fulfill 79% of its total energy supply. In response to a severe electricity supply crisis in the mid-1990s, the country has prioritized the development of indigenous energy sources, particularly renewable energy, as part of its energy policy. To address energy concerns and promote energy-saving measures, the second National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP-2) was introduced in 2020. While specific data on renewable energy use and energy savings in households in Goris is unavailable, approximately 60% of residents’ income is allocated to energy and utilities. Consequently, the municipality has identified investing in energy-efficient housing as a key priority for the smart, sustainable development of Goris. The UNECE has recommended the use of governmental incentives to retrofit apartments for improved energy efficiency and the installation of sensors and other ICTs. Additionally, the exploration of new housing options such as co-habitation, which involves shared maintenance costs and lower expenditures, has been suggested. 

#### Housing

The legal framework for housing in Armenia is not fully developed, leaving certain crucial issues unregulated. This includes aspects such as housing provision for socially vulnerable groups, the establishment and regulation of social and affordable housing, and the revitalization of the current housing stock, which lack specific legal provisions. The housing situation in Goris reflects the overall state of the country, with many residences suffering from disrepair due to ineffective management by homeowners and insufficient investment in property maintenance. In 2017, merely 10% of the housing inventory met the criteria for good quality, while energy-efficiency buildings were almost non-existent.  Additionally, historical buildings, which constitute a significant portion of the housing stock and are subject to legal regulations, were often in poor condition. Given prevalent poverty levels, there is a significant need for social housing in the city. However, less than 1% of the housing stock in Goris is designated as such, inadequate to meet the needs of the population. 

#### Disaster Risk Management

Disaster risk management in Armenia is a critical undertaking due to the country’s geographical location and exposure to various natural hazards, including earthquakes, landslides and floods. As such, the Armenian government has established a comprehensive legal and institutional framework to address these risks. The Ministry of Emergency Situations (MES) is the key coordinating body responsible for overseeing disaster management activities at the national level. Collaborating closely with local governments, civil society organizations, and international partners, the MES works to strengthen preparedness, response, and recovery efforts. In addition, active community engagement and public awareness also play an important role in disaster risk management in Armenia. While the country has made significant progress in disaster risk management, ongoing efforts are required to strengthen community resilience, improve early warning systems, and ensure more effective coordination among stakeholders. 

#### Drinking Water Supply

The water and sanitation infrastructure in Goris, Armenia, is in need of improvement, with the city facing major technical challenges and inefficiencies in its water distribution system. While the city has a good water supply and does not suffer from shortages, it grapples with issues related to wastewater treatment and the high organic pollution of the Vararakn River due to untreated sewage. The quality of drinking water is monitored by the regional water supply company and the municipality, and the city’s population consumes piped water, as there are no local groundwater wells. Additionally, all households have access to improved sanitation facilities, and water-saving measures, both with and without smart meters, have been reported to be at 40-50%. A key priority for the city is to construct a simple wastewater treatment plant. In addition, the possibility of creating synergies between different areas related to water should be considered. For example, a water strategy could include wastewater treatment, flood prevention, and hydropower. 

#### Urban Roads & Transport

Goris faces challenges in its road and transportation infrastructure. The city has a grid plan street network with three arterial roads (one main and two minor) that serve the north-south axis. However, the road network is insufficient, leading to low traffic efficiency, with an average speed of 30 to 40 kilometers per hour. Furthermore, the city faces limited access from surrounding regions, primarily due to inadequate road infrastructure, limited train connections, and the absence of an airport. In terms of public transport, the city is serviced by three transit routes (lines 1, 2, and 3) that operate in a loop fashion, servicing primarily north-south corridors of the city, and three additional transit routes that service Verishen, Khndzoresk, and Karahunj villages. While Goris is well equipped with basic infrastructure, it lacks smart infrastructure, such as “smart” roads, public transport, and recreational facilities. A primary focus should be on regulating and enhancing the street network, as well as transforming the city center’s roads into pedestrian zones to mitigate transport noise and air pollution. Currently, cycling is not a common form of transportation in Goris. However, the low volumes of traffic in the city present an opportunity to introduce cycling as a mode of transportation. 

#### Solid Waste Management

Armenia, including the city of Goris, faces significant challenges in waste management and recycling. While Goris has a 100% solid waste collection, the treatment and management of solid waste is insufficient to meet the needs of the city. This has led to issues such as littering, illegal dumping, and waste incineration, resulting in a host of environmental problems. Additionally, air quality is not monitored in the city. To address these challenges, the government of Armenia requested the Asian Development Bank (ADB) for a Policy and Advisory Technical Assistance (PATA) to develop solutions for low-cost, environmentally sound solid waste management (SWM) in small and remote communities, which can serve as a basis for future investment. As part of this project, a comprehensive SWM system for the Syunik region, which includes Goris, was proposed. This system consists of a sanitary landfill in Chapni and a transfer station in Goris, along with uniform collection and transport infrastructure. The project also includes a system of recycling in urban centers to gradually increase the rate of dry recyclable collection. 

#### Local Administration

In Armenia, there are two levels of territorial governance: the central government (*karavarutyun*) and the local level known as the community (*hamaynk*). The community level is the only self-governing level in the country. The regional or provincial administration operates under the central government, resulting in the absence of a separate budget or plan for this level of authority. The Republic of Armenia is comprised of ten *marzes* (regions) and the city of Yerevan, which consists of twelve administrative districts. Municipalities have the authority to collect local taxes from residents and businesses, such as property and land taxes, levies on commercial activities, and duties on vehicles. However, despite these revenue streams, a substantial portion of municipal finances still relies on transfers from the central government, limiting the local revenue capacity of municipalities.

//// executive_summary

// executive_summary

#### Setting the Context
Goris sits along the Goris, or Varanak, River in the mountainous Syunik Province of Armenia’s south. The town is a 240-kilometers journey southeast of Yerevan and a 33-kilometer journey north of the provincial center, Kapan. Its economy is predicated on light industry, such as food processing and textiles. There are also efforts to incorporate tourism and tech into the town’s development. This analysis also includes Verishen and Akner, two smaller towns to Goris’s north.

#### Population and Demographic Trends
The town reached a population peak in the late 1980s, around 24,000 people. The population has since shrunk to just under 20,000. People are all ages in Goris, with the largest cohorts being 5–14, 30–39, and 55–64. Population density is greatest in northern Goris, and lower in Akner and Verishen. Relative wealth, however, is greater in Akner and Verishen.

#### City Competitiveness and Economic Activity
The primary node of economic activity is in southern Goris. It appears this is also where activity is increasing the most rapidly. A second node of apparent activity is in northern Goris near Verishen.

#### Built Form
Most of Goris’s own built-up area already existed in 1985, when data becomes available. Verishen and Akner, however, were largely built-up after 2006. These built-up areas, for all three towns, represent a sixth of land in the study’s area, and are surrounded by tree cover and grassland. The towns have a very regular grid network, indicating a formal development history, and most of the population lives within a short journey to schools and health facilities.

#### Climate Conditions
Solar energy is very available in Goris, though seasonality is moderately high, meaning that it is less available in winter months. Air quality is poor, and is several times higher than the WHO recommended threshold. Surface temperatures are higher on the eastern hillsides, cooler on the more vegetated and forested western hillsides, and in between in the town itself.

#### Risk Identification
Goris is especially exposed to wildfire risk, while surface water flooding, earthquakes and landslides also pose risks. There have been frequent wildfires in Goris’s immediate vicinity, especially on the town’s southern and western sides. Fire potential is greatest between July and September. Surface water flooding threatens 36% of Goris’s built-up area and 38% of its more populous areas, though there has only been one large flood event since 1985. River flooding does not appear to be a significant threat. While liquefaction susceptibility is low, the risk of earthquakes, and their potential for damage, is moderate. Landslide susceptibility is moderate in Akner, Verishen, and northern Goris.

#### Local Institutions and Planning
At the local level, Goris is governed by a mayor and a municipal council of elders. Much of the governing responsibility, though, lies at the regional and national level. Each region, or _marz_, has a territorial planning document, while the nation has a general settlement plan, from 2003, and a development strategy, from 2014. Land use zoning is a local responsibility.
