# Use this file to set the path to the city directory. The city directory will 
# be created by the data processing step, and will have sub-folders called
# 01-user-inputs and 02-process-outputs. This directory is also where the
# visualizations will be saved.

# IMPORTANT
# The directory path must be on this file's first line.
